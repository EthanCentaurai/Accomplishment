## The Quick Intro

Accomplishment (noun) - "Something completed successfully; a goal reached."

This is a small addon with one purpose: to provide an easy way to congratulate someone, be they a guildie or a random stranger, when they earn an Achievement.

Features:
- Auto-popup when an Achievement is unlocked by someone.
- Left-click the name to congratulate the person.
- Right-click the name to remove it from the list.
- Clicking "Close" hides the window and removes all names from the list.
- Window resizes whenever new names are added or removed. It starts off small and unobtrusive but gets bigger with each new name added.
- Window can be moved about and remembers its position (saved in `layout-local.txt`).
- Congratulatory message is customisable. Use `%s` where you want the user's name to appear (or not, if you wish).
- If you prefer, you can choose to congratulate automatically instead of clicking a button.

## Configuration

An options panel can be found in-game by going to Interface -> AddOns -> Accomplishment.
